# The End Game

The aim of this project is to create a command-line based game.
The game is the final challenge of the [C# Player's Guide by RB Whitaker](https://csharpplayersguide.com/).
The intention of the challenge is to make use of the OOP principles and techniques I have practiced throughout all other challenges in the book.

### Aim of the game

In the game, there are two parties, the 'Heroes' and the 'Monsters'. The heroes win multiple rounds against the monsters, until there are none left. The heroes and monsters can both be controlled by human players, or the computer.
