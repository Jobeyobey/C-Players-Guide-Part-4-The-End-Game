This is perhaps the most exciting challenge: the one where you get to do whatever you want to the game.

[X] More heroes. You could add Mylara and Skorin, whose gear (or standard attack) is the Cannon of
Consolas, which deals 1 damage most of the time, 2 damage every multiple of 3 or 5, and 5 damage
every multiple of 3 and 5. (This adds some continuity from the early part of the book!)

[X] Add more item types. Maybe Simula’s soup is a full heal, restoring HP to its maximum.
// Bomb that deals damage to multiple enemies
// Make sure computer can pick it

[X] Add offensive attack modifiers.
// Certain attack types do extra damage to certain defense types

[X] More monster types.
