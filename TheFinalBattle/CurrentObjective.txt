Our skeletons need a hero to fight. We’ll do that by adding in the focal character of the game, the player
character, which represents the player directly, called the True Programmer by in-game role. The player
will choose the True Programmer’s name.

Objectives:
[X] The game must represent a True Programmer character with a name supplied by the user.
[X] Before getting started, ask the user for a name for this character.
[X] The game should run a battle with the True Programmer in the hero party vs. a skeleton in the monster party.



	The game might look like the following this challenge:
{
	It is TOG's turn...
	TOG did NOTHING.
	It is SKELETON's turn...
	SKELETON did NOTHING.
}
