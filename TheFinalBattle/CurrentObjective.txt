We have one critical missing piece to add before our core game is done: letting a human play it.

Objectives:

[ ] The game should allow a human player to play it by retrieving their action choices through the
	console window. For a human-controlled character, the human can use that character’s standard
	attack or do nothing. It is acceptable for all attacks selected by the human to target the first (or
	random) target without allowing the player to pick one specifically. (You can let the player pick if
	you want, but it is not required.) The following is one possible approach:

	{
		It is TOG's turn...
		1 – Standard Attack (PUNCH)
		2 – Do Nothing
		What do you want to do? 2
	}

[ ] As the game is starting, allow the user to choose from the three following gameplay modes: player
	vs. computer (the human in charge of the heroes and the computer controlling the monsters),
	computer vs. computer (a computer player running each team, as we have done so far), and human
	vs. human, where a human picks actions for both sides.
