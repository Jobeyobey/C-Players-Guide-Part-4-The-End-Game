Depending on the challenges you completed, the game is likely not very balanced anymore. Either the
heroes or the monsters win all the time. Without changing logic and mechanics, adjust things like potion
counts, attack strengths and probabilities, the number of battles and monsters they contain to produce
a version of the game where if you play wisely, you are likely to win, but if you play poorly, you will lose.

Objectives:

[ ] Tweak aspects of the game (no need to write new logic, just change parameters and character counts,
	etc.) until you have something challenging and fun.

[ ] Do what you can to ensure that The Uncoded One feels formidable.
