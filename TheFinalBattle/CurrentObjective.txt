It is time to put the final boss into the game: The Uncoded One itself. We will add this in as a third battle.

Objectives:

[ ] Define a new type of monster: The Uncoded One. It should have 15 HP and an unraveling attack that
	randomly deals between 0 and 2 damage when used. (The Uncoded One ought to have more HP than the True Programmer,
	but much more than 15 HP means the Uncoded One wins every time. We can adjust these numbers later.)

[ ] Add a third battle to the series that contains the Uncoded One.
