The game runs as a series of battles, not just one. The heroes do not win until every battle has been won,
while the monsters win if they can stop the heroes in any battle.

Objectives:

[X] There is one party of heroes but multiple parties of monsters. For now, build two monster parties:
	the first should have one skeleton. The second has two skeletons.

[X] Start a battle with the heroes and the first party of monsters. When the heroes win, advance to the
	next party of monsters. If the heroes lose a battle, end the game. If the monsters lose a battle, move
	to the next battle unless it is the last.
