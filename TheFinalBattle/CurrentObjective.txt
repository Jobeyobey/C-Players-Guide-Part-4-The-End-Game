The True Programmer does not have to fight the Uncoded One alone! The hero party can have other
heroes (companions) that should each get their turn to fight. In this challenge, we will add our favorite
arrow maker, Vin Fletcher, to the game. This challenge will also add in the possibility for an attack to sometimes miss.

Objectives:

[X] When an attack generates attack data, it must also include a probability of success. 0 is guaranteed
	failure, 1 is guaranteed success, 0.5 is 50/50, etc.

[X] Modify your attack action to account for the possibility of missing. If an attack misses, don’t damage
	the target and instead report that the attack missed. For example, “VIN FLETCHER MISSED!”

[X] Create a new character type to represent Vin Fletcher. He starts with 15 HP. If you did the Gear
	challenge, Vin should have the same standard punch attack the True Programmer has and equip him
	with a Vin’s Bow gear with an attack called quick shot that deals 3 damage but only succeeds 50% of
	the time. If you did not do the Gear challenge, give Vin quick shot as his standard attack.
