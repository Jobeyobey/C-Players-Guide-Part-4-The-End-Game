Characters can equip gear that allows them to have a second special attack. A party can have gear in their
shared inventory, but unlike items, gear is not usable until a character equips it, and it takes a turn to
equip gear from inventory.

Objectives:

[X] The game must support the concept of gear. All gear has a name and an attack they provide.

[X] Each character can equip one piece of gear.

[X] Each party also has a collection of unequipped gear.

[ ] Add the ability to perform an equip action, which knows what gear is being equipped. When this
	action runs, it should move the gear from the party’s inventory to the character.

[ ] If a character already has something equipped, the previously equipped gear should be unequipped
	and moved back to the party’s shared inventory.

[ ] The computer player should equip gear. If a character has nothing equipped but the party has
	equipable gear, the computer player should choose to equip the gear 50% of the time.

[ ] Note: If you also did the Items challenge, using potions should be a priority over equipping gear.

[ ] The console player should also have the option to equip gear. If there is more than one thing to
	equip, allow the player to choose from all available options.

[ ] The computer player should prefer the attack provided by equipped gear when one is available. Gearbased attacks are typically stronger.

[ ] If gear is equipped, the human player should be able to pick either the standard attack or the gearbased attack.

[ ] The True Programmer character should start the game with a sword item equipped. The sword
	should have a slash attack that deals two damage.

[ ] Create a dagger with the attack stab that reliably deals 1 point of damage.

[ ] Start the first battle’s skeleton with a dagger equipped. This one was prepared for battle.

[ ] Put two daggers in the team inventory for the second battle. Both skeletons will be able to use a
	dagger, but they will have to equip it first.These two were less prepared.

[ ] Optional: If you did The Game’s Status, consider showing what gear each character has equipped.
