When a character’s HP reaches 0, it has been defeated and should be removed from its party. If a party
has no characters left, the battle is over.

Objectives:

[X] After an attack deals damage, if the target’s HP has reached 0, remove them from the game.

[X] When you remove a character from the game, display text to illustrate this. For example, “SKELETON
has been defeated!”

[X] Between rounds (or between character turns), the game should see if a party has no more living
characters. If so, the battle (and the game) should end.

[X] After the battle is over, if the heroes won (there are still surviving characters in the hero party),then
display a message stating that the heroes won, and the Uncoded One was defeated. If the monsters
won, then display a message saying that the heroes lost and the Uncoded One’s forces have
prevailed.
