An attack modifier is a character attribute that adjusts attacks involving them. We will make only
defensive attack modifiers for this challenge, which apply when a character is on the receiving end of an
attack. You can add offensive attack modifiers as a part of the Making It Yours challenge.Attack modifiers
are applied when an attack action is being resolved. An attack modifier takes the current attack data as
input and produces new, potentially altered attack data. For example, it could reduce the damage done
(a resistance to the attack) or increase it (a weakness to the attack). This challenge will add a new monster
type with resistance to all attacks, reducing incoming damage by 1.

Objectives:

[X] The game must be able to represent attack modifiers. Attack modifiers take attack data as an input
	and produce new attack data as a result, possibly tweaking the attack data in the process. Attack
	modifiers also have names.

[X] All characters should be able to have a defensive attack modifier.

[X] When performing an attack, see if the target character has a defensive attack modifier before
	delivering damage to the target. If it does, allow the modifier to manipulate the attack data and use
	the modified results instead.

[X] When attack modifiers adjust damage, they should report that they changed the damage and by
	how much. For example, “STONE ARMOR reduced the attack by 1 point.”

[X] The game must support a new stone amarok character. Stone amaroks have 4 HP and a standard bite
	attack that deals 1 damage. They also have a defensive attack modifier called stone armor that
	reduces all attacks by 1 damage. If your heroes still only have a 1-point punch attack, change
	something so that the heroes can survive an encounter with stone amaroks.

[X] Add a battle that includes two stone amaroks as monsters.
