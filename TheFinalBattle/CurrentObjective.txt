Each party has a shared inventory of items. Players can choose to use an item as an action. We will add a
health potion item that players can use as an action.

Objectives:

[X] The game must support adding consumable items with the ability to use one as an action. Item types
	could be potentially very broad (keep that in mind when choosing your design), but all that is
	required now is a health potion item type. Items are usable, and when used, the reaction depends
	on the item type.

[X] A health potion is the only item type we need to add here. It should increase the user’s HP by 10
	points when used. In doing so, the HP should not rise above the character’s maximum HP.

[X] The entire party shares inventory. Ensure parties can hold a collection of items.

[X] Start the hero party with three health potions. Give each monster party one health potion.

[X] The game must support the inclusion of a use item action, along with the item to use. When this
	action runs, it should cause the item’s effect to occur and remove the item from the inventory.

[ ] The computer player should consider using a potion when (a) the team has a potion in their inventory
	and (b) the character’s health is under half. Under these conditions, use a potion 25% of the time.

[X] The console player should have the option to use a potion if the party has one.

• Note: Digging through the party inventory for potions is a little tricky. It is reasonable to assume
(for now) that all items in the inventory are health potions. That will be a correct assumption until
you make other item types. This assumption simplifies the changes you need to make to the
different player types.
