Attacks should have a damage type that may affect how it works. For now, our damage types must
include at least normal and decoding, but you can add additional damage types (such as fire or ice) if you
want. The damage type primarily adds flavor to the game but also leads to additional game mechanics.
For example, we will give the True Programmer a defensive attack modifier called Object Sight, which
gives the character resistance to decoding damage.

Objectives:

[X] Attack data should include a damage type. You are free to define any damage types that you think
	make sense, but include the damage types of normal (or similar) and decoding.

[X] Have each attack use one of these types when producing damage data. Use whatever damage types
	you wish, but make The Uncoded One’s unraveling attack be decoding damage.

[X] Give the True Programmer character a defensive attack modifier called Object Sight that reduces
	decoding damage by 2.

[X] Increase the unraveling attack to deal 0 to 4 damage randomly, instead of 0 to 2, ensuring that this
	attack is the single most powerful attack in the game (but one that the hero has resistance to).
