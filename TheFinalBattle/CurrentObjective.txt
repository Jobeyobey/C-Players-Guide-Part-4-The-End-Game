This is perhaps the most exciting challenge: the one where you get to do whatever you want to the game.

[X] More heroes. You could add Mylara and Skorin, whose gear (or standard attack) is the Cannon of
Consolas, which deals 1 damage most of the time, 2 damage every multiple of 3 or 5, and 5 damage
every multiple of 3 and 5. (This adds some continuity from the early part of the book!)

[X] Add more item types. Maybe Simula’s soup is a full heal, restoring HP to its maximum.
// Bomb that deals damage to multiple enemies
// Make sure computer can pick it

[X] Add offensive attack modifiers.
// Certain attack types do extra damage to certain defense types

[ ] More monster types.

[ ] Add attack side effects, which allow an attack to run other logic when an attack happens. Maybe a
Shadow Octopoid with a grapple attack that has a chance of stealing equipped gear.
// Current iteration of this on Cannon of Consolas isn't great.
// Alternative could be to create a Special() method in the Attack IAction, which is called during the DoDamage() method.
// This Special() method could call a Special() method in weapons, as well?

[ ] Allow characters to taunt their enemies with messages like the Uncoded One saying <<THE
UNRAVELLING OF ALL THINGS IS INEVITABLE>> and a skeleton saying, “We will repel your
spineless assault!”

[ ] Allow characters to have temporary effects applied to them. For example, a poison effect that deals
1 damage per turn for three turns.
// Would be cool to have poison effect on daggers?

[ ] Craft gear or recruit allies between rounds
// Can create poison dagger, code a sword with an upgrade etc.
// Can find allies as you progress
// Could have an item that summons an ally
